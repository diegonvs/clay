## Variants and Best Pratices

- As described on Lexicon, a NavigationBar can be styled with an inverted theme. It displays navigation items in a dark background with light text. It is always placed right below the header. Use `inverted` property for this.

- `triggerLabel` property is mandatory because it specifies the name of the trigger of the dropdown that will be placed when the screen when on small screens.

### Item

For enabling more personalization on NavigationBar items, you can pass `<ClayNavigationBar.Item>` component to specify the element that will be rendered as an item.

- Use the property `active` to specify which element is currently active on the navigation.

- `nav-link` class is mandatory for styling the children of ClayNavigationBar.Item as a NavigationBarItem but if you don't prefer to follow lexicon, you can style with you want.
